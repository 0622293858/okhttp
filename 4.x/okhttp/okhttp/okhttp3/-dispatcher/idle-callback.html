<p>A callback to be invoked each time the dispatcher becomes idle (when the number of running
calls returns to zero).</p>
<p>Note: The time at which a <a href="../-call/index.html">call</a> is considered idle is different depending on whether it
was run <a href="../-call/enqueue.html">asynchronously</a> or <a href="../-call/execute.html">synchronously</a>. Asynchronous calls
become idle after the <a href="../-callback/on-response.html">onResponse</a> or <a href="../-callback/on-failure.html">onFailure</a>
callback has returned. Synchronous calls become idle once <a href="../-call/execute.html">execute()</a> returns.
This means that if you are doing synchronous calls the network layer will not truly be idle
until every returned <a href="../-response/index.html">Response</a> has been closed.</p>
